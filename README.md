# Blogy

A minimal portfolio website built with React, TanStack Router, and Tailwind CSS, using Supabase for the backend. This project serves as my personal website.

It is a space where I document what I learn as a developer, including my knowledge, experiences, study materials, and topics that catch my interest. I write about front-end development, JavaScript, TypeScript, and other subjects related to software development that I find useful or worth sharing ðŸ¤ .
